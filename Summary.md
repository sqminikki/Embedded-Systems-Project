# Morse Blink LED Project

## What does it do?

The program takes in English characters and converts each character to its Morse code equivalent, and then prints the Morse code snippets to the MilkV-Duo console. 

## Challenges:
The main challenge we faced as a duo team was setting up our respective workstations to work together and efficiently.

## Overall:
Samantha thought this was a very interesting project and gave us the opportunity to push through solving problems with the hardware, through analysis of the hardware documentation.

Elijah thought the project was cool, in the way that we had to force ourselves to read through the documentation and find out how to get the hardware to accept the commands that the software was instructing.
